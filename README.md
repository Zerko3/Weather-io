# Project overview

The project is a weather application on the browser. The application displays the relativ data for the location based on the users input. The data is displayed for the hour, day and week. It contains UV, wind, view distance, humidity, sunrise and sunset as additional information.

## The goal and aim for this project

The main goal was to pass the exam in my university. I wanted to learn how to fetch and await an API call, how to use the Model View Controller arhitecture and how to apply some object oriented programming (OOP) in the sorce code.

## Used programming languages

For this application I used vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML as the markup language.
